# My Portfolio Site

Hi, I am Mahim Safa
I'm a highly skilled developer, DevOps, and security professional with extensive experience in Amazon Web Services (AWS), MERN stack and serverless architecture. My technical expertise, problem-solving aptitude, and adherence to industry standards enable me to provide exceptional service and deliver top-notch results. I'm a dedicated lifelong learner who stays up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. And this is my portfolio site codebase. This site is built with `astro`. I have used `Tailwind CSS` to style the site and used a `Solid JS` component for reactivity in contact form.
